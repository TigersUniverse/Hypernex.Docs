# Face Tracking

Facial Tracking in Hypernex is powered by a fork of [VRCFaceTracking](https://github.com/TigersUniverse/VRCFaceTracking) aimed to bring support to all versions of Microsoft's .NET and Mono.

With using VRCFaceTracking, it brings its own advantages and disadvantages, mainly due to the complexity of the project.

<span className="semi-bigger-text">Advantages of using VRCFaceTracking</span><br />

VRCFaceTracking is ahead of the game when it comes to both community support and tracking reliability. When it comes down to their [Unified Expressions](https://docs.vrcft.io/docs/tutorial-avatars/tutorial-avatars-extras/unified-blendshapes), quality is unmet by any other Facial Tracking provider, while still providing support for all [other standards](https://docs.vrcft.io/docs/tutorial-avatars/tutorial-avatars-extras/compatibility/overview).

On top of having improved expressions, they also have the community behind them. As of writing, their community server has over 5k members and their repository has over 800 commits. There is clear evidence of continuous support and passion behind everything they do. This makes it incredibly great for creators to work with when it comes to support, as it does not have to be generalized to just Hypernex, but can be extended to all of VRCFaceTracking.

<span className="semi-bigger-text">Disadvantages of using VRCFaceTracking</span><br />

The biggest disadvantage to all of it, is since our fork needs to run in any version of .NET, it also requires *all modules* to be recompiled. While most modules are fairly easy to recompile and keep up-to-date, some require small changes in code to ensure they run correctly on all platforms. This can be very time consuming, especially after a big VRCFaceTracking update, where everything would have to be recompiled again to support the latest version.

Another disadvantage is completely changing how VRCFaceTracking works at its core. VRCFaceTracking is designed to be an OSC application; however, our fork aims to remove (or really disable) that feature and pull data *[oddly](https://github.com/TigersUniverse/Hypernex.Unity/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/ExtendedTracking/VRCFTParameters.cs)*. This complicated code, required to extend VRCFaceTracking support without OSC, makes it more difficult for developers to contribute to our own project.

<span className="semi-bigger-text">So... Is it a good thing?</span><br />

Fortunately, because of our contributors, we can make the job a little easier on the users and creators. Below are some precompiled modules which are ready to go for any version of our VRCFaceTracking!
