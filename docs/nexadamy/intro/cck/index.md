The CCK, which stands for...

Worlds or avatars

To make something

<span className="bigger-text">K</span> it<br />

The set of tools to help you make your dreams!

...helps you achieve what you want to bring to life!

Our CCK currently has three modules

## CCK

A base for everything content creations. This can include:

+ Scripts
+ Plugins
+ Logging

This module is mostly for developers to use in their projects to either incorporate Hypernex or modify Hypernex.

## CCK.Unity/Editor

Everything for Hypernex relating to the Unity client. Manages Unity setup, building, and much more.

It also implements important Hypernex.Unity standards (such as interfaces).

All three of these modules work together to bring an exemplary experience to all developers and creators.
