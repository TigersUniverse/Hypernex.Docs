Small bug fix relating to respawning due to an issue with the Component Security update.

## Changes

+ Fixed a bug where the Respawn location would fail, causing the GameInstance to not be initialized correctly
+ Initialize the `LowestPoint` for LocalPlayers before invoking onDone after a SafeSwitchScene
