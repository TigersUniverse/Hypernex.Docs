## Changes

+ New User Interface!
  + A brand new User Interface designed by [@Awesome](https://play.hypernex.dev/dashboard?id=user_0c4564e3-1028-4f2c-a04b-77f1a169b2ac) and co-developed by [@200Tigersbloxed](https://play.hypernex.dev/dashboard?id=user_df9adfe6-f974-4b2c-a0b2-c574863c6fb6).
  + This brings new icons, designs, and user interaction crafted to simplify using Hypernex while also keeping usability and improving user experience. Most designs did not fall too far from the current implementation, so learning to use the new UI should be simple to do.
  + This changes the Dashboard, Cameras, and Nameplates!
+ Implemented new Content Creation Kit!
  + This now adds support for new features such as Avatar Parameters, Avatar Menu, Local Scripts, etc.
  + This removes support, and breaks, content published from previous versions. Please update or remove your old content.
