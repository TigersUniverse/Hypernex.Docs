# 1.3.0

Small CCK update to interface VideoPlayers. The reasoning for interfacing VideoPlayers is explained more in [Hypernex.Unity 2024.05.1b's changelogs](./../Hypernex.Unity/2024051b.md).

## Changes

+ Added `VideoPlayerDescriptor`
  + A user-managed component that allows creators to define what a VideoPlayer is in a world.
+ Added `IVideoPlayer`
  + Interface for creating and managing a VideoPlayer solution. Will be used to expand beyond Unity's built-in video players.

## Component Changes

### VideoPlayerDescriptor

The VideoPlayerDescriptor is a new component for World Creators to use. It allows creators to define a VideoPlayer to be supported by all IVideoPlayer types registered in Hypernex.Unity. The setup is simple and only has few values needing configured.

1. Create a Plane (or whatever desired surface)
    + Really, anything with a `Renderer` component works
2. Add the `VideoPlayerDescriptor` component to the GameObject
    + It does not have to be on the same GameObject as the Renderer
3. Input all `Renderer`(s) into the `VideoOutputs` List.
4. *(Optional)* Link an `AudioSource` to the `AudioOutput` field.
5. *(Optional)* Toggle `IsEmissive` depending on if you want the EmmisionMap field in your shader to be set to the Video Texture
    + If your shader's emission property is not `_EmissionMap`, then be sure to set the `ShaderEmissionProperty` field to what it is!
