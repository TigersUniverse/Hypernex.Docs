# 1.4.2

This release of the Hypernex.CCK fixes some small issues with the Security features failing.

## Changes

+ Added `Volume` to allowed list of components
+ Fixed issue where security check would throw an exception if there was a Missing Script
  + Users will still need to know if there is a Missing Script, as the check will not notify a user if this happens
