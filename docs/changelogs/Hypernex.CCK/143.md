# 1.4.3

This release of the Hypernex.CCK pulls updates from upstream changes in some dependencies and updates Plugins to also add Harmony as a soft dependency. We also added some useful properties for Plugins.

## Changes

+ Added [Lib.Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) to be loaded at runtime
  + Users can reference Harmony from their [nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Lib.Harmony) and use it in Hypernex games
+ Added `Logger` property to `HypernexPlugin`
  + This is a logger designed specifically for plugins to use. Please use this instead of `Logger.CurrentLogger`!
+ Updated kMirrors to latest
