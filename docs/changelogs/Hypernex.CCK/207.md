# 2.0.7

This new update for the CCK adds the newest changes from the current Client and Server changes, these changes being the new Video Player updates. While this is not a perfect 1:1 clone, most users will not notice a difference in the editor.

:::note

These changes do not include VLC Video Players (obviously), so only media compatible with Unity Video Players will work in editor.

:::

This update also includes small changes to improve the client experience.

## Changes

+ Automatically mark Audios to Preload Audio Data
  + This fixes issues with AudioClips not properly loading when in-game
+ Updated Emulator to match latest Client and Server changes
+ Removed old auto-generated MessagePack messages
