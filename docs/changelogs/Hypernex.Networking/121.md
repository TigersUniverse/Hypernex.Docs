# 1.2.1

Small changes for the server to fix and match the Unity client.

## Changes

+ `CoreBone`s are now serialized as `int`s for extra support
  + For example, having multiple cameras
+ Fixed `OnPlayerObject` event
+ Bumped Nexbox
  + This also requires MoonSharp and Jint to be installed alongside (no longer bundled)
